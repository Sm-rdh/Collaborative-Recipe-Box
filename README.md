# Collaborative-Recipe-Box
RecipeBox Frontend

This is the frontend for the RecipeBox application. It's a single-page HTML application that allows users to view, add, and delete recipes.

This project is a great introduction to "CRUD" (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations from a frontend. It communicates with a separate Java backend to fetch and manage the recipe data.

Features

View all submitted recipes.

Submit a new recipe via a simple form.

Delete any existing recipe.

Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look.

How to Run

Make sure your recipebox-backend (Java) server is running.

Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

The JavaScript in this file is configured to send requests to http://localhost:8080, which is where the Java backend will be running.
